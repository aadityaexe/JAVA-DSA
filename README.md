# 📘 JAVA-DSA

Welcome to the **JAVA-DSA** repository!  
This project is a comprehensive and structured collection of Java-based **Data Structures and Algorithms** problems, solutions, and notes — created as part of my personal learning journey and preparation for **coding interviews**, **competitive programming**, and **technical assessments**.

---

## 🧠 Why This Repository?

As a passionate developer, I created this repository to:

- Strengthen my **core DSA knowledge** using Java.
- Prepare for **FAANG-level interviews** and coding challenges.
- Build a consistent and organized reference of solved problems.
- Help others who are learning DSA in Java.
