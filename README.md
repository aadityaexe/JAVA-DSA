# 📘 C++ DSA

Welcome to the **C++-DSA** repository!
This project is a **collection of LeetCode problems and coding interview practice questions**, solved using **C++**. It is part of my preparation for **technical interviews**, **coding rounds**, and **competitive programming**.

---

## 🧠 Why This Repository?

* Solve **LeetCode questions** and track my progress.
* Strengthen **core DSA concepts** using C++.
* Build an **organized reference of coding interview problems**.
* Prepare for **FAANG-level interviews** and online assessments.
